- Save → Push → Done!

#### B) `HOW_TO_EDIT_OFFERS.md` - Step-by-Step Guide
- Complete guide for non-programmers
- Real examples
- Copy-paste ready
- FAQ included

#### C) JavaScript Auto-Loader
- Automatically loads offers from config file
- Updates all languages
- No manual HTML editing needed!

**How It Works**:
1. You edit `offers-config.js` (just text!)
2. Save the file
3. Run: `git add . && git commit -m "Updated offers" && git push`
4. Wait 2 minutes → Live! ✅

**Files Created**:
